## Download IDE

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great IDE where you can develop your code and edit many kinds of files. Download VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for Debian/Ubuntu systems (.deb, center).

## Important Extensions

We recommend you get the Python extension for VS code with [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). You can also search for the extension with the id: `ms-python.python` in VS Code's extension search bar.

Python 3 should already be installed along with Ubuntu 20.04. You can check the version with `python3 --version` in Terminal.

### Fun Extensions

If you want to customize your IDE, check out the [Material Theme](https://material-theme.site/). In VS Code, use this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) to install the extension. Alternatively, you can search for the extension ID `Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme`. Once installed, type `Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for “Preferences: Color Theme”. You will then be able to choose from all the Material themes.

Another nice extension is the [VS Code Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons). The extension ID is `vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons`.
